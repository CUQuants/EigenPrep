## Data Format

- All questions are stored in CSV files in the `data/` directory.
- Each file represents a category (e.g., `brain-teasers.csv`, `finance.csv`).
- **CSV columns:**
  - `category`: The category name (e.g., "Brain Teaser")
  - `question`: The question text
  - `answer`: The correct answer (as a string)
  - `type`: The question type (e.g., "text")

**Example:**
```csv
category,question,answer,type
Brain Teaser,"What is 2+2?",4,text
```

## Customization

- **Add new questions:**
  - Edit or add CSV files in the `data/` directory.
  - Follow the same column format as above.
- **Change the logo:**
  - Replace `assets/eigenprep.png` with your own PNG file.
- **Change app settings:**
  - Edit `config/config.yaml` (e.g., version, debug mode).

---

## Extending the App

- **Add new quiz types or features:**
  - Extend the PyQt5 UI in `src/ui/` (e.g., add new windows or dialogs).
- **Add new categories:**
  - Add new CSV files to `data/` and they will appear in the category dropdown.
- **Contribute code:**
  - Fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

## Troubleshooting
