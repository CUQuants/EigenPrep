## Architecture
- `src/ui/main_window.py`: Main menu window (start quiz, OA, stats, settings, quit)
- `src/ui/quiz.py`: Quiz window (category selection, timed quiz, feedback, override)
- `data/`: CSV files for each question category
- `config/config.yaml`: App configuration (version, debug, etc.)

## Editing Questions
- Edit or add questions by modifying the CSV files in the `data/` directory.
- Each row should have: `category,question,answer,type`.
