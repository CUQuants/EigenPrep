Finance,"Black-Scholes Intuition: What happens to a call option's value when volatility increases, and why?","Call option value increases. Higher volatility increases the probability of large price movements. Since options have asymmetric payoffs (unlimited upside, limited downside), higher volatility increases the expected payoff while the downside remains capped at zero.",text
Finance,"Delta Hedging: You're short a call option with delta 0.6. The underlying stock moves up by $1. How much stock do you need to buy to maintain delta neutrality?","You need to buy 0.6 shares per option contract. Being short the call means you have -0.6 delta exposure per contract. To neutralize this, you need +0.6 delta from the underlying stock, which means buying 0.6 shares.",text
Finance,"Risk-Free Rate Impact: How does an increase in the risk-free rate affect call and put option prices?","Call prices increase, put prices decrease. Higher risk-free rates increase the present value of the expected stock price (since we discount at a higher rate in the risk-neutral measure), making calls more valuable. For puts, the higher discount rate reduces the present value of the strike price, making puts less valuable.",text
Finance,"Put-Call Parity: A stock trades at $100, a call option with strike $105 trades at $8, and the risk-free rate is 5%. What should a put option with the same strike and expiration trade at? (Assume 1 year to expiration)","Using put-call parity: C - P = S - K × e^(-rT)\n8 - P = 100 - 105 × e^(-0.05×1)\n8 - P = 100 - 105 × 0.9512 = 100 - 99.88 = 0.12\nTherefore, P = 8 - 0.12 = $7.88",text
Finance,"Gamma Risk: Explain why gamma is highest for at-the-money options.","Gamma measures the rate of change of delta. At-the-money options have the highest uncertainty about finishing in or out of the money, so small stock price changes have the largest impact on the option's moneyness and thus delta. Deep in-the-money options have delta ≈ 1, and deep out-of-the-money options have delta ≈ 0, both with low gamma.",text
Finance,"Arbitrage Opportunity: A stock trades at $50. A call option with strike $45 trades at $3. Is there an arbitrage opportunity?","Yes. The call option is trading below its intrinsic value of $50 - $45 = $5. Arbitrage: Buy the call for $3, exercise immediately for $45, sell the stock for $50. Profit = $50 - $45 - $3 = $2 per contract.",text
Finance,"Volatility Smile: Why do out-of-the-money puts typically have higher implied volatility than at-the-money options?","The volatility smile/skew exists because: (1) Crash risk - markets tend to fall faster than they rise, increasing demand for downside protection; (2) Leverage effect - as stock prices fall, debt-to-equity ratios increase, making stocks riskier; (3) Supply/demand imbalances - institutional demand for portfolio insurance drives up put prices.",text
Finance,"Forward Price Calculation: A non-dividend paying stock trades at $100. The risk-free rate is 4%. What's the 6-month forward price?","F = S × e^(rT) = $100 × e^(0.04×0.5) = $100 × e^0.02 = $100 × 1.0202 = $102.02",text
Finance,"Dividend Impact on Options: How do dividends affect call and put option prices?","Dividends decrease call prices and increase put prices. Dividends reduce the expected future stock price (since the stock goes ex-dividend), which reduces the expected payoff of calls and increases the expected payoff of puts. The stock price drops by approximately the dividend amount on the ex-dividend date.",text
Finance,"American vs European Options: When is it optimal to exercise an American call option early on a non-dividend paying stock?","Never. It's never optimal to exercise an American call early on a non-dividend paying stock. The option has time value that would be lost upon exercise. It's always better to sell the option in the market than to exercise it early.",text
Finance,"VaR Calculation: You have a portfolio worth $10 million with daily volatility of 2%. What's the 1-day 95% VaR?","95% VaR corresponds to the 5th percentile of the distribution. For a normal distribution, this is -1.645 standard deviations.\nVaR = $10M × 2% × 1.645 = $329,000",text
Finance,"Sharpe Ratio: A portfolio has an expected return of 12% with volatility of 15%. The risk-free rate is 3%. What's the Sharpe ratio?","Sharpe Ratio = (Expected Return - Risk-free Rate) / Volatility\n= (12% - 3%) / 15% = 9% / 15% = 0.6",text
Finance,"Duration and Convexity: A bond has a duration of 5 years. Interest rates increase by 1%. By approximately how much does the bond price change?","ΔP/P ≈ -Duration × Δr = -5 × 0.01 = -0.05 or -5%\nThe bond price decreases by approximately 5%.",text
Finance,"Carry Trade: Explain the mechanics of a currency carry trade.","A carry trade involves borrowing in a low-interest-rate currency and investing in a high-interest-rate currency. Profit comes from the interest rate differential. Risk comes from adverse currency movements that can more than offset the interest rate advantage. The trade is profitable if the high-yielding currency doesn't depreciate by more than the interest rate differential.",text
Finance,"Credit Default Swap Pricing: What factors determine the price of a Credit Default Swap?","Key factors include: (1) Probability of default of the reference entity; (2) Expected recovery rate in case of default; (3) Time to maturity; (4) Risk-free interest rate; (5) Correlation between default risk and interest rates. The CDS spread reflects the expected loss given the probability of default and recovery assumptions.",text
Finance,"Repo Rate: Explain what a repo rate is and its significance.","A repo (repurchase agreement) rate is the interest rate at which one party sells securities to another with an agreement to repurchase them at a higher price at a specific future date. It's essentially a secured loan where securities serve as collateral. Repo rates are crucial for monetary policy transmission and short-term funding markets.",text
Finance,"Efficient Market Hypothesis: If markets are efficient, how can active managers add value?","Even in efficient markets, active managers can potentially add value through: (1) Exploiting temporary inefficiencies before they're arbitraged away; (2) Taking advantage of behavioral biases; (3) Superior risk management; (4) Access to unique information or analytical capabilities; (5) Providing liquidity services; (6) Market microstructure advantages.",text
Finance,"Yield Curve Shapes: What does an inverted yield curve typically signal?","An inverted yield curve (short-term rates > long-term rates) typically signals expected economic recession. It suggests that investors expect central banks to cut rates in the future due to economic weakness. Historically, yield curve inversions have been reliable predictors of recessions, though the timing can vary significantly.",text
Finance,"Option Moneyness and Theta: How does theta (time decay) vary with option moneyness?","Theta is typically highest for at-the-money options, especially close to expiration. ATM options have the most time value to lose. Deep ITM options have little time value (mostly intrinsic value), and deep OTM options have little value overall. The relationship is non-linear and depends on time to expiration and volatility.",text
Finance,"Portfolio Beta: You have a portfolio with 60% stocks (beta = 1.2) and 40% bonds (beta = 0.1). What's the portfolio beta?","Portfolio Beta = Σ(Weight × Beta)\n= 0.6 × 1.2 + 0.4 × 0.1\n= 0.72 + 0.04 = 0.76",text
Finance,"Liquidity Risk: How does liquidity risk affect option pricing?","Liquidity risk increases option prices through wider bid-ask spreads and higher implied volatilities. Illiquid options are harder to hedge, requiring higher risk premiums. Market makers demand compensation for inventory risk and difficulty in unwinding positions. This is particularly pronounced for exotic options and during market stress.",text
Finance,"Backwardation vs Contango: Explain the difference between backwardation and contango in futures markets.","Contango: Futures prices > spot prices (upward sloping curve). Common for financial assets due to carrying costs (storage, insurance, financing). Backwardation: Futures prices < spot prices (downward sloping curve). Common for commodities with convenience yield (value of holding physical commodity). The relationship reflects storage costs, convenience yield, and financing costs.",text
Finance,"Greeks Relationships: If a call option has delta 0.7 and the put option with the same strike has delta -0.2, what can you conclude?","This violates put-call parity relationships. For European options, Call Delta - Put Delta should equal 1 (for stocks) or e^(-rT) (more precisely). Here: 0.7 - (-0.2) = 0.9, which suggests either mispricing, American options, dividends, or other factors affecting the relationship.",text
Finance,"Interest Rate Parity: USD/EUR spot rate is 1.20, USD risk-free rate is 2%, EUR risk-free rate is 1%. What should the 1-year forward rate be?","Using covered interest rate parity:\nF = S × (1 + r_domestic) / (1 + r_foreign)\nF = 1.20 × (1.02) / (1.01) = 1.20 × 1.0099 = 1.2119",text
Finance,"Volatility Trading: You believe realized volatility will be lower than implied volatility. How do you trade this view?","Sell volatility by: (1) Selling straddles/strangles; (2) Selling options and delta-hedging; (3) Ratio spreads; (4) Calendar spreads (if you expect volatility to decrease over time). The key is to be short vega while managing other Greeks through hedging.",text
Finance,"Market Microstructure: What causes bid-ask spreads and how do they vary?","Bid-ask spreads compensate market makers for: (1) Inventory risk; (2) Adverse selection (trading against informed investors); (3) Order processing costs. Spreads are wider for: less liquid stocks, higher volatility, larger trade sizes, during market stress, and for stocks with more asymmetric information.",text
Finance,"Monte Carlo in Finance: How would you use Monte Carlo simulation to price a barrier option?","(1) Generate random paths for the underlying asset using geometric Brownian motion; (2) For each path, check if the barrier is breached; (3) Calculate the payoff at expiration for paths that don't breach the barrier (or do breach for knock-in options); (4) Discount the average payoff to present value; (5) Use variance reduction techniques like antithetic variates for efficiency.",text
Finance,"Credit Risk Modeling: What's the difference between expected loss and unexpected loss in credit risk?","Expected Loss = Probability of Default × Loss Given Default × Exposure at Default. This is the mean expected loss that should be priced into loans. Unexpected Loss is the volatility around this expected loss, representing the potential for losses to exceed expectations. Banks hold capital against unexpected losses, not expected losses.",text
Finance,"Regulatory Capital: Explain the concept of risk-weighted assets in banking regulation.","Risk-weighted assets adjust bank assets for credit risk to determine regulatory capital requirements. Different assets receive different risk weights: government bonds (0%), residential mortgages (35%), corporate loans (100%), etc. Total capital must be at least 8% of risk-weighted assets under Basel III. This system ensures banks hold more capital against riskier assets.",text
Finance,"Algorithmic Trading Strategy: Describe a pairs trading strategy and its risks.","Pairs trading involves buying one stock and shorting a related stock when their price relationship diverges from historical norms, expecting convergence. Example: Long Coca-Cola, short Pepsi when the spread widens. Risks include: (1) Fundamental changes breaking the relationship; (2) Timing risk - spreads can widen further; (3) Execution risk; (4) Model risk in defining 'normal' relationships; (5) Regime changes in correlation.",text
