Probability,"Two Envelope Problem: You have two envelopes, one containing twice as much money as the other. You pick one envelope and find $100 inside. Should you switch to the other envelope?","You should NOT switch. This is a classic paradox. The envelope you picked contains $100, so the other envelope contains either $50 or $200 with equal probability. The expected value of switching is (0.5 × $50) + (0.5 × $200) = $125, which seems better than $100. However, this reasoning is flawed because it assumes equal probability for the two scenarios, which isn't correct given the constraint that one envelope contains exactly twice the other.",text
Probability,"Coin Bias Estimation: You flip a biased coin n times and get h heads. What's your best estimate of the probability p that the coin lands heads?","Using maximum likelihood estimation, the best estimate is p̂ = h/n. This maximizes the likelihood function L(p) = C(n,h) × p^h × (1-p)^(n-h). Taking the derivative and setting to zero: dL/dp = 0 gives p̂ = h/n.",text
Probability,"Bertrand's Box Paradox: You have three boxes: one with two gold coins, one with two silver coins, and one with one gold and one silver coin. You randomly pick a box and draw a gold coin. What's the probability the other coin in the same box is also gold?","2/3. Using Bayes' theorem: P(GG|drew gold) = P(drew gold|GG) × P(GG) / P(drew gold) = (1 × 1/3) / (1/2) = 2/3. The key insight is that drawing a gold coin from the GG box can happen in two ways (either coin), while drawing from the GS box can only happen one way.",text
Probability,"Gambler's Ruin: A gambler starts with $k and plays until reaching $0 or $N. Each round, they win $1 with probability p and lose $1 with probability q = 1-p. What's the probability they reach $N before $0?","If p ≠ 0.5: P(k) = [1 - (q/p)^k] / [1 - (q/p)^N]; If p = 0.5: P(k) = k/N. This is derived by setting up the recurrence relation P(k) = p × P(k+1) + q × P(k-1) with boundary conditions P(0) = 0 and P(N) = 1.",text
Probability,"Monty Hall with n Doors: There are n doors with one prize. You pick one door, then the host opens k doors (where k < n-2) that don't have the prize. Should you switch?","Yes, switch. Your initial probability of winning is 1/n. After the host opens k doors, there are n-k-1 remaining doors you can switch to. The probability the prize is among these doors is (n-1)/n. Since you're switching to all of them collectively, your winning probability becomes (n-1)/n, which is better than 1/n.",text
Probability,"Coupon Collector with Bias: A cereal company produces n different coupons with probabilities p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ. What's the expected number of boxes you need to buy to collect all coupons?","This is complex for general probabilities. For the special case of uniform probabilities (pᵢ = 1/n), the expected number is n × Hₙ where Hₙ = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n ≈ n × ln(n) + γn for large n (γ ≈ 0.577 is Euler's constant).",text
Probability,"Secretary Problem: You interview n candidates sequentially and must decide immediately after each interview whether to hire them. You can't go back to previous candidates. What strategy maximizes your probability of hiring the best candidate?","Use the '37% rule': observe the first ⌊n/e⌋ candidates without hiring anyone, then hire the first candidate better than all previously seen ones. This gives a success probability approaching 1/e ≈ 0.368 as n → ∞.",text
Probability,"Ballot Problem: In an election, candidate A receives a votes and candidate B receives b votes, where a > b. What's the probability that A is always ahead throughout the counting?","(a-b)/(a+b). This is Bertrand's ballot theorem. The key insight is that the number of valid ballot sequences where A is always ahead equals the total number of sequences times (a-b)/(a+b).",text
Probability,"Random Walk Return Probability: A symmetric random walk starts at 0. What's the probability it returns to 0 at least once?","1 (certain return). For a symmetric random walk in one dimension, P(return to 0) = 1. However, the expected return time is infinite. In two dimensions, return probability is also 1, but in three or more dimensions, the return probability is less than 1.",text
Probability,"Geometric Distribution Race: Two people flip coins with success probabilities p₁ and p₂ respectively. What's the probability person 1 gets their first success before person 2?","p₁/(p₁ + p₂ - p₁p₂). We can derive this by considering all possible scenarios: person 1 succeeds on round 1 (probability p₁), both fail on round 1 and person 1 succeeds on round 2, etc. This forms a geometric series.",text
Probability,"Poisoned Wine: You have 1000 bottles of wine, one of which is poisoned. You have 10 servants who can taste the wine. The poison takes exactly 1 hour to kill. How do you identify the poisoned bottle in 1 hour?","Use binary representation. Assign each bottle a 10-bit binary number (0-999). Each servant corresponds to a bit position. Servant i tastes all bottles whose binary representation has bit i set to 1. After 1 hour, the pattern of dead servants gives you the binary representation of the poisoned bottle number.",text
Probability,"Birthday Paradox Extension: In a room of n people, what's the probability that at least k people share the same birthday?","This is much more complex than the standard birthday paradox. For k=2, we use inclusion-exclusion. For general k, we typically use approximations or computational methods. For k=3 and n=88, the probability exceeds 50%.",text
Probability,"St. Petersburg Paradox: A fair coin is flipped until it lands heads. You win $2^n where n is the number of flips. What's the fair price to play this game?","The expected value is infinite: E[X] = Σ(n=1 to ∞) (1/2)^n × 2^n = Σ(n=1 to ∞) 1 = ∞. However, most people wouldn't pay more than a few dollars due to diminishing marginal utility of money and practical constraints.",text
Probability,"Polya Urn Model: An urn starts with r red balls and b black balls. At each step, draw a ball, note its color, return it, and add another ball of the same color. What's the probability the nth ball drawn is red?","r/(r+b). Remarkably, this probability doesn't depend on n! This is because the Polya urn has a 'rich get richer' property, and the limiting proportion of red balls follows a Beta distribution.",text
Probability,"Matching Problem (Derangements): n people put their hats in a box and randomly retrieve one hat each. What's the probability that no one gets their own hat?","1/e (approximately). The exact probability is Σ(k=0 to n) (-1)^k/k! which approaches 1/e as n increases. For any n ≥ 1, this probability is very close to 1/e ≈ 0.368.",text
Probability,"Banach's Matchbox Problem: A mathematician carries two matchboxes, each with n matches. He randomly chooses a box each time he needs a match. What's the probability that when he first finds an empty box, the other box has exactly k matches?","C(2n-k, n) × (1/2)^(2n-k) for k = 0, 1, ..., n. This involves finding the probability of specific sequences in a two-dimensional random walk.",text
Probability,"Two Generals Problem: Two generals need to coordinate an attack. They can only communicate via unreliable messengers who may not deliver messages. Is it possible to guarantee coordination?","No, it's impossible to guarantee coordination with unreliable communication. This is a fundamental result in distributed computing. Even with confirmation messages, there's always uncertainty about whether the last message was received.",text
Probability,"Red-Blue Cards: A deck has r red cards and b blue cards. Cards are drawn without replacement until all cards of one color are drawn. What's the expected number of cards drawn?","(r+b+1)/(r+1) × (r+b+1)/(b+1) - 1. This can be derived using the negative hypergeometric distribution or by considering the problem as finding the expected position of the last card of the minority color.",text
Probability,"Buffon's Needle: A needle of length L is dropped on a floor with parallel lines spaced distance D apart (D > L). What's the probability the needle crosses a line?","2L/(πD). This famous result allows estimation of π through physical experiments. The probability comes from integrating over all possible angles and positions of the needle.",text
Probability,"Chinese Restaurant Process: Customers enter a restaurant sequentially. The first sits at table 1. Each subsequent customer sits at an occupied table with probability proportional to the number of people already there, or starts a new table with probability proportional to α. What's the expected number of occupied tables after n customers?","α × (Ψ(n+α) - Ψ(α)) where Ψ is the digamma function. For large n, this is approximately α × ln(n). This process is important in Bayesian nonparametrics.",text
Probability,"Elo Rating Convergence: Two players with true skills θ₁ and θ₂ play games with Elo rating updates. Under what conditions do their ratings converge to their true relative strengths?","Ratings converge if the learning rate K decreases appropriately over time (e.g., K ∝ 1/√t) and games are played frequently enough. The difference in ratings should converge to 400 × log₁₀(10^(θ₁-θ₂)) in the limit.",text
Probability,"Galton Board (Bean Machine): Balls drop through a triangular array of pegs, bouncing left or right with equal probability at each peg. After n levels, what's the distribution of final positions?","Binomial distribution B(n, 1/2). The position k has probability C(n,k) × (1/2)^n. For large n, this approximates a normal distribution with mean n/2 and variance n/4.",text
Probability,"Russian Roulette Variant: A revolver has n chambers, k of which contain bullets. Players take turns firing at themselves. If they get a bullet, they lose. If they get an empty chamber, they pass the gun to the next player without spinning. What's the optimal strategy?","This depends on your position and the number of bullets. Generally, you want to fire at positions least likely to contain bullets. If you're first and there are fewer bullets than empty chambers, fire immediately. The analysis involves game theory and conditional probabilities.",text
Probability,"Parking Function: n cars with preferred parking spots 1, 2, ..., n arrive sequentially. Car i prefers spot i but will take the first available spot ≥ i. A parking function is a sequence of preferences that allows all cars to park. How many parking functions are there?","(n+1)^(n-1). This surprising result connects to spanning trees of complete graphs via the Matrix-Tree theorem. Parking functions are important in algebraic combinatorics.",text
Probability,"Martingale Betting Strategy: You have $100 and play a fair coin flip game, winning or losing $1 per flip. You use the martingale strategy: double your bet after each loss. What's the probability you'll eventually win money before going broke?","With finite capital, the martingale strategy will eventually fail with probability 1. If you start with $2^n - 1$ and can make bets up to $2^(n-1), you'll go broke with probability 1/2^n, but when you do go broke, you lose everything. The expected value remains 0 (fair game), but the strategy has high variance and guaranteed eventual ruin.",text
