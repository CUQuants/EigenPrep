Brain Teaser,"Clock Hands: At what time between 3:00 and 4:00 do the hour and minute hands of a clock overlap?","3:16:22 (approximately). The hands overlap when the minute hand catches up to the hour hand. At 3:00, the hour hand is at 90° and moves at 0.5°/minute. The minute hand moves at 6°/minute. Setting up the equation: 6t = 90 + 0.5t, solving gives t = 16.36 minutes = 16 minutes 22 seconds.",text
Brain Teaser,"Burning Ropes: You have two ropes, each takes exactly 60 minutes to burn completely. The ropes burn at inconsistent rates. How can you measure exactly 45 minutes?","Light the first rope at both ends and the second rope at one end simultaneously. When the first rope burns out (30 minutes), light the other end of the second rope. The second rope will burn out in another 15 minutes, giving you exactly 45 minutes total.",text
Brain Teaser,"100 Doors: There are 100 doors, initially all closed. Person 1 opens every door. Person 2 closes every 2nd door. Person 3 toggles every 3rd door. This continues until person 100. Which doors remain open?","Only doors 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 remain open. These are perfect squares. A door is toggled once for each of its divisors. Only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors (because one divisor is repeated: the square root).",text
Brain Teaser,"Weighing Balls: You have 12 balls, identical except one is heavier. Using a balance scale only 3 times, how do you find the heavy ball?","First weighing: 4 balls vs 4 balls. If balanced, the heavy ball is in the remaining 4. If unbalanced, it's in the heavier group. Second weighing: Take 2 balls from the group of 4 and compare. If balanced, it's one of the remaining 2. If unbalanced, it's the heavier one. Third weighing: Compare the final 2 candidates if needed.",text
Brain Teaser,"Two Egg Problem: You have 2 eggs and a 100-story building. You want to find the highest floor from which an egg won't break. What's the minimum number of drops needed to guarantee finding the answer?","14 drops. Start at floor 14. If it breaks, test floors 1-13 with the second egg (worst case: 13 + 1 = 14 drops). If it doesn't break, go to floor 27 (14+13). Continue with gaps of 12, 11, 10, etc. The sequence is: 14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100.",text
Brain Teaser,"Airplane Seats: 100 passengers board a plane with 100 seats. The first passenger sits randomly. Each subsequent passenger sits in their assigned seat if available, otherwise sits randomly. What's the probability the last passenger sits in their assigned seat?","50%. At any point, only two seats matter: seat 1 and seat 100. If someone sits in seat 1, everyone else sits correctly and the last person gets seat 100. If someone sits in seat 100, the last person gets seat 1. The probability is 1/2.",text
Brain Teaser,"Coin Flips: Alice flips a coin until she gets HT. Bob flips until he gets HH. Who wins on average?","Alice wins. Expected flips for HT: 4. Expected flips for HH: 6. This is because after getting H, if Alice gets T she wins, but if she gets H she starts over. For Bob, after getting H, if he gets H he wins, but if he gets T he must start completely over.",text
Brain Teaser,"Pirates and Gold: 5 pirates must divide 100 gold coins. They vote in order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th). A proposal passes with majority support. If it fails, the proposer is thrown overboard. Pirates are rational and prefer more gold, but prefer staying alive above all. How does pirate 1 divide the coins?","Pirate 1 takes 98 coins, gives 1 coin to pirate 3, and 1 coin to pirate 5. Reasoning backwards: If only pirates 4 and 5 remain, pirate 4 takes all 100 coins. So pirate 5 will support any proposal giving him ≥1 coin. Pirate 3 knows that if it gets to pirate 4, he gets nothing, so he'll accept ≥1 coin. Pirate 1 needs only 2 supporters (himself + 2 others) out of 5.",text
Brain Teaser,"Ants on a Triangle: 3 ants start at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. Each ant randomly picks a direction and walks along the edge. What's the probability they don't collide?","1/4. For no collisions, all ants must move in the same direction (clockwise or counterclockwise). Each ant has 2 choices, giving 2³ = 8 total outcomes. Only 2 outcomes avoid collisions: all clockwise or all counterclockwise. Probability = 2/8 = 1/4.",text
Brain Teaser,"Defective Coin: You have 1000 coins, one of which is defective (heads on both sides). You pick a coin randomly and flip it 10 times, getting 10 heads. What's the probability it's the defective coin?","Using Bayes' theorem: P(defective|10 heads) = P(10 heads|defective) × P(defective) / P(10 heads) = 1 × (1/1000) / [(1/1000) × 1 + (999/1000) × (1/2)¹⁰] = (1/1000) / [(1/1000) + (999/1000) × (1/1024)] ≈ 0.512 or about 51.2%.",text
Brain Teaser,"Light Switches: You have 3 light switches outside a room and 3 light bulbs inside. You can flip switches but can only enter the room once. How do you determine which switch controls which bulb?","Turn on the first switch for a few minutes, then turn it off. Turn on the second switch and leave it on. Enter the room. The bulb that's on corresponds to switch 2. The bulb that's off but warm corresponds to switch 1. The bulb that's off and cool corresponds to switch 3.",text
Brain Teaser,"Bridge Crossing: 4 people need to cross a bridge at night with one flashlight. The bridge holds only 2 people. They have different crossing times: 1, 2, 5, 10 minutes. When two cross together, they must go at the slower person's pace. What's the minimum time to get everyone across?","17 minutes. Strategy: (1,2) cross together (2 min), 1 returns (1 min), (5,10) cross together (10 min), 2 returns (2 min), (1,2) cross together (2 min). Total: 2+1+10+2+2 = 17 minutes.",text
Brain Teaser,"Cube Coloring: A cube has 6 faces painted with 3 different colors (2 faces each color). How many distinct cubes are possible?","3 distinct cubes. This is a classic problem in combinatorics with rotational symmetry. We must account for the fact that rotations of the same coloring pattern are considered identical. Using Burnside's lemma or systematic enumeration of the possible arrangements gives 3 distinct colorings.",text
Brain Teaser,"Prisoner's Dilemma Variant: 100 prisoners each have a unique number 1-100. There's a room with 100 boxes, each containing a slip with a unique number 1-100. Each prisoner can open 50 boxes. If all prisoners find their number, they all go free. Otherwise, all are executed. What strategy gives them the best chance?","Each prisoner should start with the box corresponding to their number, then follow the chain. If box n contains number m, next open box m. This gives approximately 31% success rate (much better than the 1/2¹⁰⁰ chance with random strategy). The key insight is that this strategy fails only if there's a cycle longer than 50.",text
Brain Teaser,"Chocolate Bar: You have a 6×8 chocolate bar. You want to break it into 48 individual squares. Each break splits one piece into two pieces. How many breaks do you need?","47 breaks. Each break increases the number of pieces by 1. Starting with 1 piece, you need 47 breaks to get 48 pieces. This is independent of the breaking strategy - you always need exactly n-1 breaks to get n pieces.",text
Brain Teaser,"Hourglass: You have two hourglasses: one measures 7 minutes, the other 11 minutes. How do you measure exactly 15 minutes?","Start both hourglasses simultaneously. When the 7-minute glass runs out, flip it (11-minute glass has 4 minutes left). When the 11-minute glass runs out, flip it (7-minute glass has 3 minutes left). When the 7-minute glass runs out again, flip the 11-minute glass (which now has 8 minutes of sand in the bottom). When this flipped 11-minute glass runs out, exactly 15 minutes have passed.",text
Brain Teaser,"Sock Drawer: A drawer contains red socks and blue socks. If you pick 2 socks randomly, the probability of getting a matching pair is 1/2. How many socks are in the drawer?","4 socks. Let r = red socks, b = blue socks. P(matching) = [C(r,2) + C(b,2)] / C(r+b,2) = 1/2. This gives us [r(r-1) + b(b-1)] / [(r+b)(r+b-1)] = 1/2. Solving: r(r-1) + b(b-1) = (r+b)(r+b-1)/2. Testing small values: r=3, b=1 works, giving 4 total socks.",text
Brain Teaser,"Russian Roulette: Two players play Russian roulette with a 6-shot revolver containing 2 bullets in consecutive chambers. Player A goes first. What's the probability A wins?","5/7. If bullets are in positions 1-2, A loses immediately. If in positions 2-3, A survives, B gets bullet. If in positions 3-4, A survives, B survives, A gets bullet. If in positions 4-5, A survives, B survives, A survives, B gets bullet. If in positions 5-6, A survives, B survives, A survives, B survives, A gets bullet. If in positions 6-1, A survives, B gets bullet. A wins in 5 out of 7 cases.",text
Brain Teaser,"Ant and Rubber Band: An ant starts at one end of a 1-meter rubber band and walks toward the other end at 1 cm/sec. The rubber band stretches uniformly at 1 m/sec. Does the ant ever reach the other end?","Yes, eventually. Although the band stretches faster than the ant walks, the ant's position as a fraction of the band's length increases over time. The ant's fractional position increases at rate 1/(100 + 100t) per second. Integrating this gives a logarithmic growth, which eventually reaches 1.",text
Brain Teaser,"Wise Men and Hats: 3 wise men are buried in sand up to their necks, each wearing either a red or blue hat. They can see the others' hats but not their own. They're told at least one hat is red. They must deduce their own hat color. After a long silence, the first wise man says 'red.' How did he know?","The wise man reasoned: 'If my hat were blue, then the other two would see one blue (mine) and one red (the other's), and each would think: If my hat were also blue, the third person would see two blues and know his hat is red (since at least one is red). Since he's silent, my hat must be red.' But they're both silent, so my hat must be red.",text
Brain Teaser,"Betting Game: You start with $100. A fair coin is flipped repeatedly. Each time, you can bet any amount you currently have. Heads: you win your bet amount. Tails: you lose your bet amount. What betting strategy maximizes your expected wealth after n flips?","Bet everything on each flip. Expected value after n flips is 100 × (3/2)ⁿ if you bet everything each time. This is because E[wealth] = 100 × 2ⁿ × (1/2)ⁿ = 100 × (3/2)ⁿ. However, this strategy has high risk - you could lose everything on the first flip.",text
Brain Teaser,"Monty Hall with Boxes: There are 1000 boxes, one contains a prize. You pick box 1. Monty opens 998 boxes that don't contain the prize. Should you switch to the remaining box?","Yes, definitely switch. Your initial box has probability 1/1000 of containing the prize. The remaining 999 boxes collectively had probability 999/1000. After Monty eliminates 998 boxes, the single remaining box has probability 999/1000. The probability increases dramatically compared to the 3-door version.",text
Brain Teaser,"Fair Division: You and your friend must divide a cake fairly, but you have different preferences for different parts. How do you ensure both think they got at least half?","'I cut, you choose' protocol. One person cuts the cake into two pieces, the other chooses which piece they want. The cutter, knowing the chooser will pick the larger piece (by their valuation), will cut as evenly as possible by their own valuation. This guarantees both parties think they got at least half.",text
Brain Teaser,"Chameleon Colors: On an island, there are 13 red, 15 blue, and 17 green chameleons. When two chameleons of different colors meet, they both change to the third color. Can all chameleons ever be the same color?","No. The differences between the populations (mod 3) remain invariant. Initially: (13,15,17) ≡ (1,0,2) (mod 3). Each color change preserves these residues mod 3. Since the residues are not all equal, the chameleons can never all be the same color.",text
Brain Teaser,"Water Jug Problem: You have two jugs: 5 liters and 3 liters. You need to measure exactly 4 liters. How do you do it?","(1) Fill the 5L jug completely. (2) Pour from 5L to 3L jug (5L jug now has 2L). (3) Empty the 3L jug. (4) Pour the 2L from the 5L jug into the 3L jug. (5) Fill the 5L jug completely again. (6) Pour from 5L to 3L jug until full (this takes 1L since 3L jug already has 2L). The 5L jug now contains exactly 4L.",text
Brain Teaser,"Handshakes: At a party, some people shake hands. Prove that an even number of people shook hands an odd number of times.","Consider the sum of all handshakes each person made. Each handshake involves exactly two people, so this sum equals twice the total number of handshakes, which is even. Since the sum is even, there must be an even number of odd terms in the sum (people who shook hands an odd number of times).",text
Brain Teaser,"Consecutive Integers: Can you write 1000 as a sum of consecutive positive integers?","Yes, multiple ways. 1000 = 8 × 125, and 125 is odd, so we can write 1000 as a sum of 8 consecutive integers centered around 125: 122 + 123 + 124 + 125 + 126 + 127 + 128 + 129. Also, 1000 = 55 + 56 + ... + 64 (10 consecutive integers), and other combinations.",text
Brain Teaser,"Digital Clock: On a 12-hour digital clock (showing hours and minutes), what's the probability that a randomly selected time has at least one repeated digit?","69/144 ≈ 47.9%. Total possible times: 12 × 60 = 720. But on a 12-hour clock, we show 12:00-12:59 and 1:00-11:59, giving us 144 distinct displays (12×12 possible digit combinations). Times with no repeated digits: 12:34, 12:35, etc. Counting systematically: 74 times have no repeated digits, so 144 - 74 = 70 have at least one repeated digit.",text
Brain Teaser,"Coin Arrangement: You have 10 coins in a row, some heads up, some tails up. You can flip any 7 consecutive coins. Can you always make all coins heads up?","No, not always. Consider the parity of the number of tails. Each move flips 7 coins, changing the parity of the number of tails. If you start with an odd number of tails, you'll always have an odd number of tails after any sequence of moves. Since having all heads means 0 tails (even), you cannot reach this state from an odd number of tails.",text
Brain Teaser,"Knight's Tour: Can a knight on a chessboard visit every square exactly once and return to its starting position?","Yes, this is called a closed knight's tour. While finding one requires careful construction, they exist for 8×8 boards. One method uses the Warnsdorff rule (always move to the square with the fewest onward moves) or systematic backtracking. Open tours (not returning to start) are easier to find and prove existence for various board sizes.",text
